This is an HTML/CSS practice project with the overall goal of recreating the Google homepage.

I have learned a lot after having finished this project. It took several different attempts to try and get everything where it needed to be and while the end result isn't an exact spitting image of the actual Google homepage, I believe it is acceptable and you cannot really tell unless the actual homepage is setup side-by-side with my attempt. Overall, I believe this to have been a great learning experience.
